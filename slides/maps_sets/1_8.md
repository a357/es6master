  In contrast to Sets, WeakSets are <b><em>collections of objects only</em></b> and not of arbitrary values of any type.
</li>
<li>
  The WeakSet is weak: References to objects in the collection are held weakly. If there is no other reference to an object stored in the WeakSet, they can be garbage collected.
