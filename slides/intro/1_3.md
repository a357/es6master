[Ecma International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) is an international private (membership-based) 
non-profit standards organization for information and communication systems.
It acquired its current name in 1994, when the <b>European Computer Manufacturers Association</b> (ECMA) 
changed its name to reflect the organization's global reach and activities. 
As a consequence, <b>the name is no longer considered an acronym and no longer uses full capitalization</b>.
