###Temporal dead zone
In ECMAScript 2015, let will hoist the variable to the top of the block. 
However, referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError. The variable is in a <b>"temporal dead zone"</b> from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.
```javascript
1| function do_something() {
2|  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: foo is not defined
3|  let foo = 2;
4| }
```
```javascript
1| function do_something() {
2|   console.log(foo); // undefined
3|   var foo = 2;
4| }
```
