###Description (No binding of this)

Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) value 
(a new object in the case of a constructor, 
undefined in [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) function calls, 
the context object if the function is called as an "object method", etc.). 
This proved to be annoying with an object-oriented style of programming.
```javascript
 1| var Person = function(name){
 2|  this.name = name||""
 3| }
 4| var p1 = new Person();//Person {name: ""}
 5| 
 6| var fn1 = function(){
 7|  'use strict'
 8|  return this;
 9| }
10| fn1();//undefined
11| var fn2 = function(){
12|  return this;
13| }
14| fn2()//Window {...}
```
