###A more powerful array literal

Without ES2015 spread, if you have an array and want to create a new array with 
the existing one being part of it, the array literal syntax is no longer sufficient 
and you have to fall back to imperative code, using a combination of [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push), [splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice), [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat), etc. 
With spread syntax this becomes much more succinct

```javascript
1| var parts = ['shoulders', 'knees'];
2| var lyrics = ['head', ...parts, 'and', 'toes'];
3| // ["head", "shoulders", "knees", "and", "toes"]
```
