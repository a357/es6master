###[Static methods](http://jsbin.com/bapemel/edit?js,console)

```javascript
 1| class Point {
 2|   constructor(x, y) {
 3|     this.x = x;
 4|     this.y = y;
 5|   }
 6| 
 7|   static distance(a, b) {
 8|     const dx = a.x - b.x;
 9|     const dy = a.y - b.y;
10| 
11|     return Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
12|   }
13| }
14| 
15| console.log(Point.distance(new Point(5, 5), new Point(10, 10)));
```
Static methods are called without instantiating their class and are also <strong><em>cannot be called through a class instance</strong></em>.
