##[Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor)

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. 
There can <strong><em>only be one special method with the name "constructor"</em></strong> in a class.
</br> 
</br> 
A <strong><em>SyntaxError</strong></em> will be thrown if the class contains <strong><em>more than one</em></strong> occurrence of a constructor method.
</br>
</br>
A constructor can use the <strong><em>super</strong></em> keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.
