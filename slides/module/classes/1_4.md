###Class body
The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets {...}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor).

The bodies of class declarations and class expressions are executed in [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).
